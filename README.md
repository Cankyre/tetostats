### Pieces per second (PPS)
PPS is the statistic that measures the speed of a given player. This is calculated by dividing the number of pieces placed by the time spent in the game, in seconds.

Where ``pieces`` is the total number of Tetriminoes the player has placed, and ``t`` is the time in seconds.

### Attack per minute (APM)
APM represents the frequency of damage a player sends. This is calculated by dividing the number of lines sent (received or cancelled by the opponent) by the total time spent in the game.
